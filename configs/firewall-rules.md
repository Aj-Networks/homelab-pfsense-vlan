# Firewall Rules

Per-VLAN rule chains as configured in pfSense 2.8.1. Rules are evaluated **top-to-bottom** — first match wins.

## VLAN 10 — Users (10.10.10.0/24)

| # | Action | Protocol | Source | Destination | Port | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Pass | UDP | VLAN10 net | 10.10.10.1 | 53 | Allow DNS to pfSense only |
| 2 | Pass | TCP | VLAN10 net | 10.10.20.5 | 9100 | Allow printing to printer |
| 3 | Block | TCP/UDP | VLAN10 net | DOH_IPS alias | 443, 853 | Block DNS-over-HTTPS / DoT |
| 4 | Block | TCP/UDP | VLAN10 net | any | 53 | Block plain DNS to WAN |
| 5 | Block | any | VLAN10 net | RFC1918 alias | any | Block inter-VLAN traffic |
| 6 | Pass | any | VLAN10 net | any | any | Route via VPN_FAILOVER gateway |
| 7 | Block | IPv6 | any | any | any | Drop all IPv6 |

## VLAN 20 — IoT (10.10.20.0/24)

| # | Action | Protocol | Source | Destination | Port | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Pass | UDP | VLAN20 net | 10.10.20.1 | 53 | Allow DNS to pfSense only |
| 2 | Block | TCP/UDP | VLAN20 net | DOH_IPS alias | 443, 853 | Block DoH / DoT |
| 3 | Block | TCP/UDP | VLAN20 net | any | 53 | Block plain DNS to WAN |
| 4 | Block | any | VLAN20 net | RFC1918 alias | any | Block inter-VLAN traffic |
| 5 | Pass | any | VLAN20 net | any | any | Route via VPN_FAILOVER gateway |
| 6 | Block | IPv6 | any | any | any | Drop all IPv6 |

## VLAN 30 — Guest (10.10.30.0/24)

| # | Action | Protocol | Source | Destination | Port | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Pass | UDP | VLAN30 net | 10.10.30.1 | 53 | Allow DNS to pfSense only |
| 2 | Block | TCP/UDP | VLAN30 net | DOH_IPS alias | 443, 853 | Block DoH / DoT |
| 3 | Block | TCP/UDP | VLAN30 net | any | 53 | Block plain DNS to WAN |
| 4 | Block | any | VLAN30 net | RFC1918 alias | any | Block inter-VLAN traffic |
| 5 | Pass | any | VLAN30 net | any | any | Route via VPN_FAILOVER gateway |
| 6 | Block | IPv6 | any | any | any | Drop all IPv6 |

## VLAN 40 — Lab (10.10.40.0/24)

| # | Action | Protocol | Source | Destination | Port | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Pass | UDP | VLAN40 net | 10.10.40.1 | 53 | Allow DNS to pfSense only |
| 2 | Block | TCP/UDP | VLAN40 net | DOH_IPS alias | 443, 853 | Block DoH / DoT |
| 3 | Block | TCP/UDP | VLAN40 net | any | 53 | Block plain DNS to WAN |
| 4 | Block | any | VLAN40 net | RFC1918 alias | any | Block inter-VLAN traffic |
| 5 | Pass | any | VLAN40 net | any | any | Route via VPN_FAILOVER gateway |
| 6 | Block | IPv6 | any | any | any | Drop all IPv6 |

> **Note:** VLAN 40 is excluded from Suricata IDS monitoring — Cisco lab protocols generate high false-positive noise.

## VLAN 50 — Management (10.10.50.0/24)

| # | Action | Protocol | Source | Destination | Port | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Pass | UDP | VLAN50 net | 10.10.50.1 | 53 | Allow DNS to pfSense only |
| 2 | Pass | any | VLAN50 net | any | any | Full access — routes via WAN (no VPN) |

> **Note:** VLAN 50 intentionally bypasses the VPN and RFC1918 block. It needs direct WAN access and full internal reach for break-glass administration. No RFC1918 block = can reach all VLANs.

## Aliases Referenced

| Alias | Contents | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `DOH_IPS` | Known DoH provider IPs | Block encrypted DNS bypass on ports 443/853 |
| `RFC1918` | 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16 | Block all inter-VLAN routing |

## Key Design Decisions

- **DNS is locked to pfSense** — clients cannot query external resolvers directly
- **DoH/DoT blocked** — prevents bypassing DNS controls via encrypted DNS
- **RFC1918 block enforces hard VLAN isolation** — no cross-VLAN traffic without an explicit rule above it
- **VPN_FAILOVER is the default gateway** — all passing traffic exits through Mullvad, never raw WAN
- **IPv6 fully blocked** — eliminates any tunnel leak vector
- **VLAN 50 is the only exception** — intentional break-glass design, direct WAN, full internal reach
