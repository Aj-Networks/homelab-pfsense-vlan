# NAT Rules

All 12 manual Outbound NAT rules as configured in pfSense 2.8.1. Mode is set to **Manual Outbound NAT**.

There are **zero rules mapping internal subnets to WAN** — this is the foundation of the kill switch.

## Key Design Decisions

- **Manual mode is required** — Auto Outbound NAT would create WAN rules automatically, breaking the kill switch
- **Every subnet has a rule on both tunnels** — ensures clean failover with no gap
- **No WAN NAT rules exist** — if both VPN tunnels drop, traffic is blocked, not leaked
- **VLAN 50 NAT rules (6 and 12) are intentionally unused** — VLAN 50 routes via WAN directly by firewall design, so these rules never fire. They exist to keep the subnet list symmetric across both tunnels.
